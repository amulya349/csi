-map divs - to open dynamically

-the divs(hidden jpgs) on the images - to be distinguished 
   between 
 what is authentic evidence, and which one is a mislead,
  and should somehow effect the player's advancement

   It may be such that, the player doesnt get to go to
   furthur level unless he/she has collected all the 
   correct evidences from that level.

                      (Or) 
  
  what you can do is, let him/her collect whatever
   evidences he/she needs to collect from each level
                 
               (may be max 5),
   
   but at the end, he/she should not be able to get to
   encode.html to decode the encryption unless
   he/she collects ALL the right evidences at EACH level.

  and the WINNER is he/she who decodes that encode wala 
  page too.
 

- evidences on evidence page to be opened dynamically

- To add page linked from encode.html, that says that Y is the culprit.
