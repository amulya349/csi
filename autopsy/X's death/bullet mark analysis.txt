Ballistic fingerprinting:

Ballistic fingerprinting refers to a set of forensic techniques that rely on
 marks that firearms leave on bullets to match a bullet to the gun it was fired with.
[1] It is a subset of forensic ballistics (the application of ballistics to legal 
questions) and internal ballistics (the study of events between the firing of a gun 
and the bullet leaving the barrel).[1]
