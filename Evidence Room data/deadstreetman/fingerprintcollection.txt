How Fingerprints are Collected

Collecting Patent Prints

Patent prints are collected using a fairly straightforward method: 
photography. These prints are photographed in high resolution with a forensic measurement scale in the image for reference. Investigators can improve the quality of the images by using low-angle or alternate light sources and/or certain chemicals or dyes during photography, but this is usually not necessary.

Collecting Latent Prints

One of the most common methods for discovering and collecting 
latent fingerprints is by dusting a smooth or nonporous surface with 
fingerprint powder (black granular, aluminum flake, black magnetic, etc.). If 
any prints appear, they are photographed as mentioned above and then lifted from 
the surface with clear adhesive tape. The lifting tape is then placed on a latent 
lift card to preserve the print.

However, fingerprint powders can contaminate the evidence and ruin the 
opportunity to perform other techniques that could turn up a hidden print or 
additional information. Therefore, investigators may examine the area with an 
alternate light source or apply cyanoacrylate (super glue) before using powders.

Alternate Light Source (ALS): It is becoming more commonplace for investigators 
to examine any likely surfaces (doors, doorknobs, windows, railings, etc.) with 
an alternate light source. These are laser or LED devices that emit a particular
 wavelength, or spectrum, of light. Some devices have different filters to provide 
a variety of spectra that can be photographed or further processed with powders or 
dye stains. For example, investigators may use a blue light with an orange filter 
to find latent prints on desks, chairs, computer equipment or other objects at 
the scene of a break-in.
