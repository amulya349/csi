Closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras can produce images or 
recordings for surveillance[1] purposes, and can be either video cameras, 
or digital stills cameras. Marie Van Brittan Brown 
was the inventor of the CCTV camera.


These cameras do not require a video capture card because they 
work using a digital signal which can be saved directly to a computer. 
The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be achieved with more 
compression (MPEG-2 is standard for DVD-video, and has a higher compression 
ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is 
adjustable for the amount of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture 
needed or desired). The highest picture quality of DVD is only slightly lower 
than the quality of basic 5:1-compression DV.
