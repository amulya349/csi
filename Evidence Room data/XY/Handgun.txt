A handgun is a firearm designed to be handheld, in either one or both hands. 
This characteristic differentiates handguns as a general class of firearms from long 
guns such as rifles and shotguns (which usually can be mounted against the shoulder).
Major handgun subtypes are the revolver and pistol; other subtypes include derringers, 
single-shot pistols, semi-automatic pistols, pepperboxes, and machine pistols.
