A spy pen camera is an example of electronic miniaturization because it contains tiny versions of larger equipment,
 such as a still photo camera or an audio/video recording system. All of its inner components are connected by very 
narrow wires; a pinhole camera system is used with a small viewing lens near the top of the pen case. Besides a choice
 of video or still image capabilities in black and white or color, spy pen cameras are available with various memory 
capacities. The amount of memory corresponds with the number of stored photos or length of video footage a particular 
spy pen camera can hold. All of the working mechanisms of this spy device are hidden inside a case that not only looks 
identical to a ball point pen, but writes like one as well.

Some pen cases are slimmer than others, but virtually all of these types of spy cameras look realistic. They are 
usually designed like the classy style of business pen and may be in any color, but are often in rich jewel shades 
such as deep red or dark green. Although all spy pen cameras can be used as a regular writing instrument, some
 types have limited ink supplies because the cartridge is small. Other hidden camera pens take standard ink 
refill cartridges. The clip on section of a spy pen camera, as well as the clicking mechanism on its top, 
can usually be moved to turn the different features on and off.
