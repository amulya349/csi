A GPS tracking unit is a device that uses the Global Positioning System to
 determine the precise location of a vehicle, person, or other asset to 
which it is attached and to record the position of the asset at regular intervals. 
The recorded location data can be stored within the tracking unit, or it may be 
transmitted to a central location data base, or internet-connected computer, 
using a cellular (GPRS or SMS), radio, or satellite modem embedded in the unit. 
This allows the asset's location to be displayed against a map backdrop either in
 real time or when analysing the track later, using GPS tracking software. 
Data tracking software 
is available for smartphones with GPS capability
