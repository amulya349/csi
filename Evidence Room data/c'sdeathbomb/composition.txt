C-4 or Composition C-4 is a common variety of the plastic explosive known as Composition C.
C4 is composed of explosives, plastic binder, plasticizer and usually a marker or odorizing taggant 
chemical such as 2,3-dimethyl-2,3-dinitrobutane (DMDNB) to help detect the explosive and identify its source.[1]
The explosive in C4 is RDX (cyclonite or cyclotrimethylene trinitramine), which makes up around 91% of 
C4 by mass.[1] The plasticizer is diethylhexyl (5.3%)[1] or dioctyl sebacate and the binder is usually 
polyisobutylene (2.1%).[1] Another plasticizer used is dioctyl adipate (DOA). A small amount of SAE 10 
non-detergent motor oil (1.6%) is also added.[1] C4 is manufactured by combining the noted 
ingredients with binder dissolved in a solvent. The solvent is then evaporated and the mixture 
dried and filtered. The final material is an off-white solid with a texture similar to modelling clay.
