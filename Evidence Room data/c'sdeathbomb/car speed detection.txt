A radar detector is an electronic device used by motorists to 
detect if their speed is being monitored by police or law enforcement 
using a radar gun. Most radar detectors are used so the driver can reduce 
the car's speed before being ticketed for speeding. Only doppler radar-based 
devices can be detected — other speed measuring devices including those using ANPR, 
piezo sensors, and VASCAR technology cannot be detected. LIDAR devices require a 
different type of sensor, although many modern detectors include LIDAR sensors. 
Most of today's radar detectors detect signals 
across a variety of wavelength bands: usually X, K, and Ka.


One of the technologies that law enforcement agencies can use to measure the speed 
of a moving vehicle uses doppler radar to beam a radio wave at the vehicle, and then 
infer the vehicle's speed by measuring the Doppler effect-moderated change in the 
reflected wave's frequency. Radar guns can be hand-held, vehicle mounted or mounted 
on a fixed object, such as a traffic signal.
Radar detectors use a superheterodyne receiver to detect these electromagnetic 
emissions from the radar gun, and raise an alarm to notify the motorist when a 
transmission is detected. False alarms can occur however due to the large number 
of devices, such as automatic door openers (such as the ones at supermarkets) and 
adaptive automotive cruise control, that operate in the same part of the electromagnetic
 spectrum as radar guns.
