A skid mark is a tire mark on the road surface produced
 by a tire 
that is locked, that is not rotating. A skid mark 
typically appears very light at the beginning of the 
skid getting darker as the skid progresses and comes
 to an abrupt end if the vehicle stops at the 
end of the skid. There are other types of tire marks 
including scuffs, scrubs and yaw marks. 
These must not be confused with skidmarks. A skid mark
 is left when the driver applies the 
brakes hard, locking the wheels, but the car continues 
to slide along the road. Steering is not 
possible with the front wheels locked. Skid marks are 
generally straight but may have some 
curvature due to the slope of the road. 

Skid marks can also come about when a car suddenly 
accelerates on a slippery surface, 
or takes a hard corner.
