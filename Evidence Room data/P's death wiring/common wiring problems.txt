Human error probably isn't going to be the direct cause of a fire in your vehicle -- 
after all, being lazy isn't quite the same as striking a match and igniting a wick that
 goes into the gas tank. But if you're sloppy about maintenance, your car is going to 
be a lot more dangerous, in general, and the increased likelihood of a car fire is 
just part of the greater risks you're taking. It's true, forgetting or neglecting to 
properly take care of your car can indirectly lead to a vicious fire. That's because 
if you let broken parts, leaky seals, or faulty wiring go without repairs, it'll make 
your car a lot more hospitable to the conditions that cause a fire. An engine with a 
bad gasket is more likely to drip hazardous (and flammable) fluids. Frayed wiring is 
more likely to spark and make contact with flammable materials.
